That's pronounced 'She-tij'! 
<p>I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati exploring the technology I've come to love. 
Over the course of my life, I have always fancied myself a creative, expressing my personality and passions through my work. 
The two main outlets for my creativity are coding, and art. There's a special kind of beauty in coding till one's frustrated, 
choosing to spend time drawing as a way to relax, to then coding again later because art frustrated you. 
At the risk of sounding cliche, I find peace in this cycle. In the process of being creative.</p>

<p><b>Coding in Python,C,C++,Java,HTML,CSS,SQL and <b>always</b> hoping to learn more.</b></p>

# My Values

  <li>Shared Understanding and Respect</li>
</ul>

# How I work
<p>I believe in enjoying the work I do, and I find that I work best when I pace myself based on my mood. 
While schedules are useful to remind me what I need to do, my work ethic is very impulsive, and sporadic in it's bursts of productivity.
Regardless, I admire, and encourage responsibility, and thus make sure that I <b>always</b> deliver.</p>
